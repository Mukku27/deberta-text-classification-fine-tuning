# deberta-text-classification-fine-tuning
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating an advanced workflow for fine-tuning the `DeBERTa-v3-large` model for a binary text classification task. The project leverages high-performance training techniques, including multi-GPU support, mixed-precision (FP16), and gradient accumulation, all managed within a custom trainer class.
